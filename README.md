# Agentic-API-Engineer-without-LLM-NLP

Automates a Tedious Task:   One of the most time-consuming and critical tasks for an API engineer is to meticulously read through a Request for Proposal (RFP) or similar requirements document to extract all API-related needs. This app automates that process, saving a significant amount of time and effort.

Structured Analysis:   The multi-agent approach provides a structured and verifiable analysis. Instead of just giving a single answer, it breaks down the reasoning into logical components: business scope, explicit mentions, integration needs, and security/standards. An engineer can review each agent's findings and rationale to understand exactly why the conclusion was reached.

Confidence Scores:   The confidence scores for each agent's finding are highly useful. They give the engineer a quick sense of how strongly the requirement is stated in the document. A high score (like the 96.7 for "Integration Needs") suggests a very clear requirement, while a lower score might prompt the engineer to do a more detailed manual review of that section.

Generates a Starting Point:   The most powerful feature is the automatic generation of an OpenAPI specification (Agent 6). This provides an immediate, executable starting point for the API design. An engineer can take this JSON, import it into a tool like Swagger Editor (as the tip suggests), and immediately begin visualizing the API, identifying potential issues, and refining the design. This eliminates the need to build the initial schema from scratch.

Reduces Misinterpretation:   By providing a concrete, machine-readable output (the OpenAPI spec) based on a human-readable document (the RFP), it helps to reduce the risk of misinterpreting the requirements. This can prevent costly re-work later in the development cycle.

Minimal Dependencies:   The name of the app itself—"Minimal Dependencies"—suggests it's a lightweight tool that is easy to use and doesn't require a complex setup, which is a plus for any professional tool.
