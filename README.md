# Agentic-API-Engineer-without-LLM-NLP

Automates a Tedious Task:   One of the most time-consuming and critical tasks for an API engineer is to meticulously read through a Request for Proposal (RFP) or similar requirements document to extract all API-related needs. This app automates that process, saving a significant amount of time and effort.

Agent 1: Business Scope - This agent analyzes the document for keywords related to business objectives and scope. Its goal is to identify the overall purpose of the project. It found a business objective to "design and implement a secure enterprise-grade integration platform" and identified themes like "business," "objective," and "api," with a confidence score of 69.9.

Agent 2: Explicit API Mentions - This agent specifically looks for direct mentions of API-related terms such as "api," "apis," "endpoint," and "openapi." It found 7 "hits" with a confidence score of 75.3, confirming that APIs are explicitly mentioned as a requirement.

Agent 3: Integration & Interoperability - This agent searches for concepts related to system-to-system connectivity, such as "integration," "interoperability," and specific platform names (like SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, and Workday). This analysis has a very high confidence of 96.7, as the RFP explicitly mentions the need for an "integration platform" and "interoperability between multiple vendor systems."

Agent 4: Standards, Security, Compliance - This agent focuses on technical requirements like API standards (e.g., REST, OpenAPI), security (e.g., OAuth2, JWT), and compliance (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR). It found multiple mentions of each category with a high confidence of 92.4, providing a solid basis for the generated API specification.

Agent 5: Decision Summary (Voting) - This is a meta-agent that aggregates the findings of the previous agents. Based on the high confidence scores and evidence from Agents 1-4, it concludes that "APIs are Required" with an overall aggregate score of 334.3.

Agent 6: Generated OpenAPI (Dynamic) - Using the evidence gathered by the other agents, this final agent automatically generates a draft of an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. It creates endpoints for resources explicitly mentioned in the RFP, such as /customers, /orders, /invoices, and /employees. The generated spec also includes security definitions (OAuth2) and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) for each resource.


Structured Analysis:   The multi-agent approach provides a structured and verifiable analysis. Instead of just giving a single answer, it breaks down the reasoning into logical components: business scope, explicit mentions, integration needs, and security/standards. An engineer can review each agent's findings and rationale to understand exactly why the conclusion was reached.

Confidence Scores:   The confidence scores for each agent's finding are highly useful. They give the engineer a quick sense of how strongly the requirement is stated in the document. A high score (like the 96.7 for "Integration Needs") suggests a very clear requirement, while a lower score might prompt the engineer to do a more detailed manual review of that section.

Generates a Starting Point:   The most powerful feature is the automatic generation of an OpenAPI specification (Agent 6). This provides an immediate, executable starting point for the API design. An engineer can take this JSON, import it into a tool like Swagger Editor (as the tip suggests), and immediately begin visualizing the API, identifying potential issues, and refining the design. This eliminates the need to build the initial schema from scratch.

Reduces Misinterpretation:   By providing a concrete, machine-readable output (the OpenAPI spec) based on a human-readable document (the RFP), it helps to reduce the risk of misinterpreting the requirements. This can prevent costly re-work later in the development cycle.

Minimal Dependencies:   The name of the app itself—"Minimal Dependencies"—suggests it's a lightweight tool that is easy to use and doesn't require a complex setup, which is a plus for any professional tool.
